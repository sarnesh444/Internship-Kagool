## Day 1 May 1st 2020
#### The Inception

* I have been introduced to the Analytics Team they have been quite warm and welcoming.
* Had a walk-through of work-flows/project-lifecycle at the firm.


## Day 2-4 May2-5 2020
#### Virtual On-Boarding

* I have been asked to join for a call with the HR and Sys-Admin for the on-boarding process.
* We had to setup [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/) and mstc(Temote-Desktop connection) to connect to the off-shore VM
* Being an analytics intern I had to work with a BI tool being an esteemed organization Kagool is a Microsoft Gold Partner so I was fortunate enough to get a Power-BI premium access.[Power-BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) 
* We also had to set-up [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/)

##### I have been using slack and teams for a while now and hands-down Teams is easy-to-use and has everything at one place there is no need to worry about Team-Viewer(for requesting-control) and Zoom for calls.

## Day 5-7 May 6th-8th 2020
#### Task was to explore Azure Cloud and it's connectivity to Power-BI
List to explore:
1.	Power BI
2.	DAX Queries
3.	Azure Analysis Services (AAS)
4.	Connecting Power BI with Data Lake
5.	Basics of Database

The names seemed a little intimidating but being the one intrigued by technology I did get an overview of them,haven't used them much though.
Here are my learnings.

## Day 8 May 9th 2020
#### Task was to explore the COVID-19 Dashboard built at Kagool Analytics using Power-BI
I was amazed to see how intutive the visualizations were,I have always believed "A picture Speaks a Thousand Words" you might have the best team creating models but what makes it intutive and understandable to everyone is Business-Intelligence has the responsibility of presenting the insights gained from data.

This meeting had the spotlight on me to identify my skills,learnings and see where I best fit the bill.


## Day 10 May 12th 2020
#### And then it happened.....I have been introduced to Mr.Dylan Mead my POC.
Hi Saranesh,

Welcome to Kagool!

Lalith has asked me if I have any R&D tasks you might be able to help with. Looking at your CV it looks like you have some good experience with machine learning and clustering, specifically in Python.

I’ve got the following task you can have a go at – feel free to expand it in the direction you want:

•	Apply knowledge of machine learning and clustering to the Global Superstore dataset (a sample dataset containing 50,000 sales records for a global superstore – available to download as .xlsx here).

•	Investigate and see what interesting insights can be made – e.g. trends, predicting sales/profit, clustering products/locations, etc.

•	Bring in data from other sources where useful – e.g. weather/population/demographics, etc.

•	Visualise the results in Power BI Desktop using the built-in Python visual.

The goal is to produce visuals in Power BI that would be useful for a Sales executive – whether it is describing the data and finding trends or providing information that can drive business decisions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Dylan Mead
Data Engineer


This was when I started working on the [Global SuperStore Dataset]() 

* The initial target was to explore best-practises for clustering and pre-processing and also create a documentation for the life-cycle of problem at hand and...
I managed to achieved ![this](https://github.com/sarnesh444/InternshipKagool/tree/master/references_for_clustetring)


## Day 11: May13th 2020
#### I had a All-Hands-Meet with the entire Kagool family and Phase-1 Data Cleaning

The All-Hands-Meet was'nt quite new to my arena,being an operations member with demonstrated history of actively taking part in meets and events BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT BALL GAME(the product-walkthroughs RnR for achievers all felt so nice)
We also had a session of soap-box "A mainstream topic(overview of various SDLCs) with a narrative mastery" LITERALLY WOW!

I had started working on pre-processing the dataset,this the most time consuming part of a data-product lifecycle
* I got a skeleton understanding of the data 

Outcones:
*All the features are categorical and had to be handled with utmost care(P.S I used frequency encoding the other options were 
One-Hot(keeping in mind the number of unique values one-hot has been eliminated) or Label Encoding(Was a backup),also had to perform Pearson-correlation for feature extraction and selection.

## Day 12 : May14th 2020
#### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Viz's help explore and understand the data even better after rigrous pre-processing I encoded all the categorical features into numeric since most of the models accept only numerical inputs.
