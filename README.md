# Internship-Kagool

### Application to Acceptance 2nd March 2020 to 13th March 2020
I have applied to this firm via a reference,after the initial proceedings,I had a telephonic interview with Mr.Kalyan Gupta:thanks for keeping the process very smooth,later I have been invited to join the firm as an Analytics Intern at their Hyderabad office for a 3 month period.
[Offer](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/Saranesh%20Kanumuri%20-%20Kagoo%20Intern%20.pdf)

But unfortunately I could not join them due to the COVID-19 Pandemic,I have been lucky enough to be accepted as a virtual-intern.

My sincere thanks to [Mr.Kalyan Gupta Delivery Head](https://in.linkedin.com/in/kalyan-brahmandlapally-5ab62425),Mr.Uma(HR),Mr.Babu(Sys-Admin),[Mr.Dylan Analytics POC](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dylanmead),[Mr.Chaithanya Automation Lead](https://in.linkedin.com/in/chaithanya-palthi-42002163),[Mr.Hammad Automation POC](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hammadkamran)
[Kagool](https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/company/kagool-ltd)

## Day 1 May 1st 2020
#### The Inception

* I have been introduced to the Analytics Team they have been quite warm and welcoming.
* Had a walk-through of work-flows/project-lifecycle at the firm.


## Day 2-5 May2-5th 2020
#### Virtual On-Boarding

* I have been asked to join for a call with the HR and Sys-Admin for the on-boarding process.
* We had to setup [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com/) and mstc(Temote-Desktop connection) to connect to the off-shore VM
* Being an analytics intern I had to work with a BI tool being an esteemed organization Kagool is a Microsoft Gold Partner so I was fortunate enough to get a Power-BI premium access.[Power-BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/) 
* We also had to set-up [Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) and [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/) for communication.

#### I have been using slack and teams for a while now and I think hands-down Teams wins,since it is easy-to-use and has everything at one place there is no need to worry about Team-Viewer(for requesting-control) and Zoom(for calls).

#### A high level understanding of a Software Development Cycle
The product/feature goes through multiple phases before it can reach the client/end-user.
* Requirement Analysis from product owner
* Object Oriented Analysis & Design to make sure the devs understand the requirement of the client
* A software like [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)can be used to keep track of tasks.
* Phase 1:TODO/Development This is when after the business logic is in place and all the requirements have been analysed the developers go into the first iteration of product building based on P1 features(In an Agile env with Scrum Framework-have sprint meets to track progress and set goals for the next development cycle).
* Phase 2:After the code is checked against unit-tests the "working-feature" moves to dev-complete phase
* Phase 3:Staging, Here is where Quality Assurance Analysts comes into picture and the "working-feature"(small part of the product) becomes a victim of tests like Regression,BVA,load testing are done once the QA approves the feature it becomes QA complete.
* Phase 4:Now if the product is QA complete then it is forwarded to UAT(User Acceptance Testing) else it is assigned to "dev-iteration"
* Phase 5:If the task is moved to dev-iteration the developers will have to revamp the issue after that control shifts to Phase2.
* Phase 6:If the UAT is passed the feature moves to production,else the RCA(Root cause analysis) is done and the control shall shift based on the outcome of the RCA 
* Phase 7:Feature shifts to production,live build is released and deployed.
* Phase 8:Beta testing and feedback from users.


## Day 5-7 May 6th-8th 2020
#### Task was to explore Azure Cloud and it's connectivity to Power-BI
List to explore:
1.	Power BI
2.	DAX Queries
3.	Azure Analysis Services (AAS)
4.	Connecting Power BI with Data Lake
5.	Basics of Database

The names seemed a little intimidating but being the one intrigued by technology I did get an overview of them,haven't used them much though.
Here are my [learnings.](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/onboardingtaskAzureandPBIintro)


## Day 8 May 9th 2020
#### Task was to explore the COVID-19 Dashboard built at Kagool Analytics using Power-BI
I was amazed to see how intuitive the visualizations were,I have always believed "A picture Speaks a Thousand Words" you might have the best team creating models but what makes it intuitive and understandable to everyone is Business-Intelligence has the responsibility of presenting the insights gained from [data](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kagool-ltd_powerbi-azurecloud-activity-6656096473693904896-rjsW)


## Day 9 May 11th 2020
#### I had a special catchup with my analytics team at UK.
This meeting had the spotlight on me to identify my skills,learnings and check where I can best fit the bill.


## Day 10 May 12th 2020
#### And then it happened.....I have been introduced to Mr.Dylan Mead my POC.
Hi Saranesh,

Welcome to Kagool!

Lalith has asked me if I have any R&D tasks you might be able to help with. Looking at your CV it looks like you have some good experience with machine learning and clustering, specifically in Python.

I’ve got the following task you can have a go at – feel free to expand it in the direction you want:

•	Apply knowledge of machine learning and clustering to the Global Superstore dataset (a sample dataset containing 50,000 sales records for a global superstore – available to download as .xlsx here).

•	Investigate and see what interesting insights can be made – e.g. trends, predicting sales/profit, clustering products/locations, etc.

•	Bring in data from other sources where useful – e.g. weather/population/demographics, etc.

•	Visualise the results in Power BI Desktop using the built-in Python visual.

The goal is to produce visuals in Power BI that would be useful for a Sales executive – whether it is describing the data and finding trends or providing information that can drive business decisions.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Dylan Mead
Data Engineer


This is when I started working on the [Global SuperStore Dataset]() 

* The initial target was to explore best-practises for clustering and pre-processing and also create a documentation for the life-cycle of problem at hand and...
I managed to achieved [this](https://github.com/sarnesh444/InternshipKagool/tree/master/references_for_clustetring)


## Day 11: May13th 2020
#### I had a All-Hands-Meet with the entire Kagool family and Phase-1 of Data Cleaning...

I initially thought an All-Hands-Meet will not be quite new to my arena,being an operations member with demonstrated history of actively taking part in meets and events BUT THIS WAS A DIFFERENT BALL GAME(the product-walkthroughs RnR for achievers all felt so nice.) everything is perfectly documented and the process is remarkable,the best practises from requirement analysis to product delivery was clearly visible.
We also had a session of soap-box "An interesting topic(SDLC and it's impact on product delivery) with a narrative mastery" LITERALLY WOW!

I had started working on pre-processing the dataset,this the most time consuming part of a data-product lifecycle.
* I got a skeleton understanding of the data. 

Outcones:
*All the features are categorical and had to be handled with utmost care(P.S I used frequency encoding the other options were 
One-Hot(keeping in mind the number of unique values one-hot has been eliminated) or Label Encoding(Was a backup),also had to perform Pearson-correlation for feature extraction and selection.

## Day 12 : May14th 2020
#### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Viz's help explore and understand the data even better after rigrous pre-processing I encoded all the categorical features into numeric since most of the models accept only numerical inputs.

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/clusteringmodelinitialpythonnoPBI/nullval_after_encoding.JPG)

I wanted to see how each feature is in relation to sales(target) so created some basic visuals.
![altext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/statevssales.png)

## Day13 : May15th 2020
#### The most interesting part.....Building the Machine Learning Model

Since the dataset falls under unsupervised category(at a very high level:output label us not known) so based on the various features I wanted to cluster the data points into various groups,I have a read a couple of notes on clustering methodologies like DBSCAN but I have settled for Hierarchical clustering though an old-school technique yet gives promising results always.

I have used the elbow method to get the optimum number of clusters
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/InternshipKagool/blob/master/clusteringmodelinitialpythonnoPBI/determining_optimum_no_of_clusters_using_elbow_method.JPG)
Here is the model and [outcome](https://github.com/sarnesh444/InternshipKagool/blob/master/clusteringmodelinitialpythonnoPBI/Kagool_clustering_two_model.ipynb)


## Day14: May16th 2020
#### Seaborn the saviuor

After generating the model we wanted to create eye-catchy visuals so that they can be embedded in power-bi to create a dashboard,let me quote an example "based on the client requriement data has been wrangled,processed,explored,insights have been gained but they have to be presentable and should be understood by everyone"here is when BI-tools come into play.
Day-1 of visuals
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/regionvsales.png)

Outcome [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/sns.ipynb)

## Day 15: May18th 2020
#### Making the wrong right....

The previous visual was quite simple was'nt it,yes that is not what is expected.
* I had a catchup with my POC Dylan to talk about the work so far and expectations ahead.
* I understood the visuals were to be grouped by country and each purchase has to be preserved and should not be summarized.
* So had to group each entry based on country,after high processing I have reduced the dataset to have only entries of top5 countries by   sales,we wanted to get each sale as a point on the visual from the top5 countries.
SEABORN=GOD LEVEL PYTHON VISUALIZATION LIBRARY check it out [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* Explored the documentation and found sns.catplot great for a categorical feature(country) vs numeric(sales).
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/all.JPG)

Outcome [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/sns_colab.ipynb)


## Day16: May19th 2020
#### Diving Deeper!
We wanted to take the visuals one notch higher so we wanted to see if a 3rd-dimension could be added to catplot
* Eg. Have categorical feature(country) on the X-axis,numeric feature(sales) on Y-axis and also a hue(3rd dim eg.ship mode) 

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/1.JPG)

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/3.JPG)


## Day 17:May20th 
#### Creating a subset of the dataset
Based on the sales from top5 countries we wanted to create a new dataset so as to make the visualization process easier
Here is the [outcome](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/new_groupby_country_vs_sales.ipynb)


## Day 18: May21st 2020
#### Group by country mark by sale

Todays goal was to have each sale on the visualization only from top5 countries eg.The highest number of sales are from USA so each point on the visual represents one sale from the country.

USA

## Day 19: May22nd 2020
#### Visualizations in tableau 
* I had some issues connecting to the off-shore VM in-order to access Power-BI
* So I tried creating a dashboard with some interactive visuals in Tableau Public Desktop.
![altext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/country_vs_sales_groupby_snscatplot/top5countriesbysales.png)

Outcome [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/saranesh.maniratna#!/vizhome/Dashboardtop5countriesbysaleskagool/Dashboard1?publish=yes)


## Day 20: May 23rd 2020
#### Stepping into PowerBI
* Before I could jump into creating dashboard pages for the original dataset I wanted to playaround with some populated data to adapt to the Power-BI ecosystem.
* The dashboard is pretty naive but was done just to understand how PBI works.
Check it out [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/samplefortestingpowerbi/sales-test.pbix)


## Day 21: May 25th 2020
#### Python+PBI=❤️
* The goal is to incorporate as many python-non-pbi visuals as possible.
* Power-BI offers a rich set of visuals but we wanted to incorporate visuals not supported by it.
* I wanted to get an overview of how python can be incorported in Power-BI find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahf6wPXHTvM)


## Day 22: May 26th 2020
#### Now making things work in Power-BI
* First the dataset has to be loaded and processed in Big-Query.
* Secondly pbi supports python visuals:drag the python icon into the page to start writing code in powerbi
* Drag the fields necessary into the Data part
* Now the code can be edited in a default python editor 
* Ctrl C+Ctrl V the code into PBI 
* And voila this how we can connect the best language for ML and the best tool for BI
* 1st Connect......

## Day 23: May 27th 2020
#### Continuing to get the visuals not available in PBI via python
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/page1mine_main.JPG)


## Day 24: May 28th 2020
#### Streak of new visuals continues
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/page2mine_main.JPG)


## Day 25: May 29th 2020
#### Streak continues......and trying to achieve interactivness via plotly.

* Along with getting new visuals we also wanted to add interactive visuals from python into power-bi.
* So I have explored Plotly a library known for interactivness 
* Some more visuals
![alt](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/page3mine_main.JPG)
* Plotly visual renders HTML File as output so as to serve interactiveness.

## Day 26: May 30th 2020
#### Goal was to create a dashboard,gather all at one place and also have defined boundaries and descriptions for each visual
* Creating new Visuals
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/page4mine_main.JPG)
* Exploring the documentation [at](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/visualVocab%20-%20withoutMapboxToken%20(1).pbix) 



# PHASE:2
## Inception of Powershell
### My firm was automating deployments and the team was looking for a resource,I wanted to help since it would be a win-win situation. 


## Day 27: June 1st 2020
#### Exploring basics of powershell...
* I have been asked to explore the fundamentals like 
    * loops 
    * conditionals
    * exception handling 
    * functions
## The biggest question was when we have "Python" that can do "ALMOST ANYTHING" why do we need "POWERSHELL"
## I am wrong : MY LEARNING: "Each disease is to be dealt uniquely" this can be an amateur analogy but that is how it works,each project has a it's own recipe and requirements the tool that can best solve the problem at hand has to be picked since my team was working on deploying resources to the Azure cloud,the Powershell(Azure Cloud) being Microsoft's brain child it had a lot of in-built functions and cmdlets that can help make the process easier,so here Powershell is a better choice when compared to Python.

Please find the learnings [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/basicsofpowershell)


## Day 28: June 2nd 2020
#### Explore logs.....
* After checking out some basics I have been asked to gain insights from the code base of the team,the functionality of the code was to   write user logs to a flat-file and deploy them to the cloud and also print warnings to the console in case of failure.Sounds simple     is'nt,actually not,the syntax of powershell is a little difficult to catch it encompassed lot of in-built functions,so had to look up   the documentation"I WROTE NO CODE BUT I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY WRITTEN" that was a task in-itself
* Simple task : Write a code to read from csv and print to the console.
  Please check it [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/readfromcsv)
 

## Day 29: June 3rd 2020
#### Explore ARM......
* Azure Resouce Manager,if were to explain it is similar to a YAML file and has a structure like JSON which is used to specify resources (eg.Azure storage,with all the specifications and attributes like apiversion etc.)and deploy them to resource groups resided within subscriptions,I found a [github page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) from azure,it is a repository of pre-defined templates that can be tailored to our requirements and using a ps1 script the specified ARM TEMPLATE can be deployed.
Check the outcomes [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/arm)


## Day 30: June 4th 2020
#### Exploring classes in powershell....
* This task was a little easy since it revolves around the OOPs concept,I had to explore how classes work in powershell and basic         concepts of classes like inheritance and costructors.
* Here are my [learnings](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/classes)


## Day 31: June 5th 2020
#### Explore the script of Azure Data Factory...
* The task was to explore a script that deploys "pipelines"(pipeline can be understood as a workflow,the data can be imported from multiple sources like RDBMS,User Reviews,csv,xlsx and storage like AWS S3,Azure facilitates all the importing,manipulating and processing via Pipelines in Azure datafactory) to Azure.


## Day 32: June 8th 2020
#### Continued exploring the ADF file AND SOME NEW LEARNINGS:
* Build first Azure data factory using Azure PowerShell: learnt about how an azure data factory works and how it can be deployed from powershell
* Analysed Azure Hierarchy
   * Subscriptions
   * Resource Groups
   * Resources
   * Pipelines
   * Activities
* Get-AzureRmDataFactoryPipeline gives the entire information related to pipelines
* Demystified importance of PsCustomObject
* CmdletBinding() the power given to programmer for framing advanced functions
* Implemented functions with begin,process and end 
* Implemented hash table and various methods of instantiating it

Check the outcomes [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/classes/readingaboutadfscriptfromhammad)


## Day 33: June 9th 2020
#### Custom Visuals in PowerBI
The goal was to get custom-interactive visuals in power-bi,my POC works with R and pbiviz has helped him achieve custom visuals in PBI so we wanted to check if it works for Python as well. 
* Step1:Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Step2:Install all the additional packages that come along-side Node.js like chocolatey
* Step3:Now using NPM install pbiviz
* Step4:After that open PBI create a regular python visual and return to Node.js command prompt run the command 
"pbiviz <nameofvisual> -t pyhtml"
* This is when I understood that pbiviz is not supported for python and only works with R.
* The only way out was to install the additional visuals offered by PowerBI to get interactiveness. 
* If you are working with R check the demo [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/custom-html-visuals-in-power-bi-using-r-2b0494894ff)

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/pbiviznosupportforpython.jpg)  
### Looks like PBIVIZ does not support python.


## Day 34:June 10th 2020
#### Time series analysis and forecast....
Today's goal was to incorporate time series in PowerBI
* Step1:Pre-process the time data in QueryEditor using simple DAX,eg.splitting time and date

* Step2:Drag in a line plot onto the canvas and drag the date field into Axis spot and parameter against which it has to be compared into the value spot

* Step3:We would like to observe trend and seasonality so shift to the Analytics bar and create a trend line and fine tune according to needs.

* Step4:We would also like to check out forecast 
   * So create forecast length(timeline you would like to observe forecast)
   * Specify an ignore last field if you like to ignore a certain time frame
   * Adjust confidence interval to tailorize forecast 
   * Color,LineStyle,Confidence Band style,transparency can be specified as well
   
* Step5:Add slicers to drill down into specifics for analyis,I have added
   * Country
   * Category
   * Ship Mode
   
* Step6:Add focus cards like...
   * Profit gained
   * Quantity
   * Discount 
Check the outcomes [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries)
![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries/timseries1.JPG)


## Day 35:June 11th 2020
#### Time series ship date ...
The goal was to create a visual where details can be drilled down.
USE CASE:Check the sales on a particular day for the same firm across multiple locations.
* Step1:Get the custom visual from R store
* Step2:To create Ship Date vs Sales and Order Date vs Sales visuals
   * Drag the custom visual onto the canvas
   * Change the date hierarchy
   * Navigate to display section to tune 
         * Color
         * Shadow
         * Title
         * Xticks,Yticks
   * Move to the analytics tailor the trend and seasonality
Check the outcome [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries)

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries/timseries2.JPG)



## Day 36:June 12th 2020
#### Decompose time....
The objective was to check sales/profit/discount over time.
##### I have used the time series decomposition visual from the store.
* Step1:Installing custom visual from store,navigate to import more visuals from the visualization tab,search for "time series         decomposition." and install it.
* Step2:Drag the visual onto the canvas and 
   * drop in the order date in time field 
   * drop in sales/profit/discount for respective visuals
* Step3:Tune the necessary details like summarization,trend,seasonality.
* Step4:To make the dashboard eye-catchy add some color and documentation.
* Step5:Most importantly since the graph is not interactive navigate to the Graphical Parameters section and play around with the plot-type this will drill down the plot keeping the parameters same thereby enabling keen observation of visuals like
   * Data Distribution over time
   * Trend
   * Seasonality
   * Remainder
Check the demonstration [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries)

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries/timeseries3.JPG)


## Day 37:June 15th 2020
#### Slice and drill.....
The objective was to drill down on the visual using maximum slicers
###### I have used time brush slicer visual from the store
* Step1:Installing custom visual from store,navigate to import more visuals from the visualization tab,search for "time series brush." and install it.
* Step2:Drag the visual onto the canvas and 
   * drop in the order date in time field 
   * drop in sales for the value field.
   * For hue drag in the country
* Step3:Tune the necessary details like summarization,select the slicers.
* Step4:To make the dashboard eye-catchy add some color and documentation.
* Step5:Most importantly since the graph is not interactive navigate to inlcude slicers,select the slicer from the visual pane and drag in the parameter to slice and will help drill down the plot thereby enabling keen observation of visuals.
   Some of the slicers I have included are:
   * Country
   * Category
   * Order priority
   * Segment
   * Ship Mode
   * Sub-Category
   * Region
Check the demonstration [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/tree/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries)

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries/timeseries4.JPG)


## Day 38:June 16th 2020
#### Bubbles...
Today's objective was to have as many parameters for comparision as possible 
We did not want to restrict a visual to only two dimensions but go beyond it so as to have a multi-dimensional visual i.e more paramters helps better understand the data.
* Step1:Installing custom visual from store,navigate to import more visuals from the visualization tab,search for "bubble chart." and install it.
* Step2:Drag the visual onto the canvas and 
   * drop in the country in name field 
   * drop in sales for the X-Axis field.
   * drop in profit for the Y-Axis field
   * Most importantly drag the quantity attribute into the size field,i.e bigger is the size of the bubble higher is the quantity.
   * Some other fields one can make use of
         * Play Axis
         * Left Bar
         * Right Bar
* Step3:Tune the necessary details like summarization,select the slicers.
* Step4:To make the dashboard eye-catchy add some color and documentation.

Summary:
BUBBLE CHART :HELPS INCLUDE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS ON A SINGLE VISUAL
HERE NAME FIELD IS SPECIFIED WITH COUNTRY ,X-AXIS IS THE SUM OF VALUES ,Y-AXIS DEPICTS THE PROFIT,,SIZE OF THE BUBBLE IS DETERMINED BY QUANTITY SOLD,PRO OF THE VISUAL IS IT NEED NOT BE RESTRICTED ONLY TO TWO DIMENSIONS FOR COMPARISON BUT MULTIPLE PARAMETERS CAN BE USED ON A SINGLE VISUAL TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA BETTER ACROSS MULTIPLE DIMENSION

## Day 39: June 17th 2020
#### Pies...
The objective was to compare the visuals in PowerBI and Python
So I created 3 visuals:
* Radial chart in python using matplotlib
* Donut chart from Power BI
* Funnel chart from Power Bi
Insights gained:PowerBI does not support features like filtering and interactiveness for python visuals 
* Radial chart is a python code:I found this [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-python-visualizations-in-powerbi-b64fe8602a8a) on a medium article.
* Donut chart
   * Drag in the visual onto the canvas
   * Drag in the attribute you would like to use for filtering into legend
   * Drag in the attribute you would like to visualize into values
* Filter chart
   * Drag in the visual onto the canvas
   * Drag in the attribute you would like to use for filtering into group
   * Drag in the attribute you would like to visualize into values

## Day 40: June 18th 2020
#### Maps...
Since the major portion of the dataset was country centric we wanted to have the sales plotted on a map
So I have installed a visual offered by PowerBI store HeatMap
   * Go to get more visuals install HeatMap 
   * Drag in the visual onto the canvas
   * Drag in the Country attribute if you have one into Location(ID) or a long,lat co-ordinates would also do
   * Drag in the attribute you would like to visualize into value field.
   * For a better understanding add 
      * Gauge
      * Focus Cards
      * Filters

## Day 41: June 19th 2020
#### Globe

Since the major portion of the dataset was country centric we also wanted to have the sales plotted on a globe
So I have installed a visual offered by PowerBI store : Globe Map
Features:
   * On giving the input of latitude and longitude it marks the countries
   * Using the attribute of visualization the height of the bar for the marker on the globe of a co-ordnate is computed
   * The intensity of the color of the marker can be decided by another attribute
      eg.darker the color more the sales for that marker
      
Process:
   * Go to get more visuals install Globe Map 
   * Drag in the visual onto the canvas
   * Drag in the Country attribute if you have one into Location(ID) or a long,lat co-ordinates would also do
   * Drag in the attribute you would like to visualize into Length of bar field.
   * Drag in other parameter which decides the intensity of the marker
   * For a better understanding add a slicer of the country

## Day 42: June 22th 2020
#### Presentable...

Even the best of the plots will be presentable when the appearance of each screen in the dashboard is noteworthy
Even though this calls for some time but not much work we wanted to do it sot that the dashboard can be more presentable 

So we wanted to revamp the apperance of each screen
Check the demo [here](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/dylanPBIvisualsSales/powerbi/timeseries)

## Day 43,44,45: June 23,24,25 2020
#### Folium ...
Haven't done much but I wanted to explore how maps could be generated in python
* When working with sales data that is location centric heat maps,maps come very handy in analyzing better.
* [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) is an excellent python library that is used to generate Map-Python visuals
* Install via 'pip install folium'
* The output can be 
   * a HTML file supported with leaflet.js 
   * a jupyter notebook output using %matplotlib inline
* Looking forward to go deeper and see what can happen
* To generate the output just run the folium_test.py file

## Day46:June 26 2020
#### Analytics Team : Knowledge Transfer & Review

* Being a Friday we had an Analytics Team Catchup for a soapbox session followed by KT&R
* We had a sessions on 
   * Integrating 3D visuals in PowerBI
   * 3D Visuals in PBI using matplotlib
   * Aggregations in PowerBI
   * In real world we usually deal with a lot of data so in-order to minimize the number of records aggregations are used
   * Ensures speed
   * Modularazation
   * No data loss since decomposed via Normal Forms
   * Works like pandas groupby aka aggregations in PBI

## The target is to embed a PBI Report in SF

## Day 47:Jul 6 2020
#### Azure Active Directory

![alttext](https://github.com/sarnesh444/Internship-Kagool/blob/master/salesforcePBI/task1PBIinSFnotuserspecific/exploring/azure-active-directory.png)
Azure AD is the built-in solution for managing identities in Office 365. Add and configure any application with Azure AD to centralize identity and access management and better secure your environment. Configure SSO and automated provisioning depending on your application's capabilities and your preferences.

###### Using Azure Active Directory Sys-Admin can configure services that can be used by a employee in an enterprise environment
###### Instead of multiple login uid/passwd for each service,every emp is assigned with uid/passwd through this single credentials services used by emp can be allocated.

###### Without AAD

## Day 50:Jul 9 2020
#### Azure Logic App

![alttext](https://sec.ch9.ms/ch9/c033/c703cff2-d99b-4c02-a5e8-d90d1185c033/introducingazurelogicapps_960.jpg?v=9963f0986fa62e56a009126ebe6c5cb1175dbfc409c6b78d065d7e54cccfe03f)

We have been using a Logic App to implement a particular task so I wanted to read about it today so that I can create one when needed.

Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.

#### Azure Logic App has:
* Trigger
* Action
* Input for each step
* Output for each step
* The outputs of each step can be used at any stage 

#### Works like this
* When a certain condition is met an action is triggered.
* There are a series of steps that will be executed after triggering.
Eg.
* When a file is added to the blob storage.(check for every 1 hour)
* Send a notification email via outlook.(there are a lot of templates like these)


### Logic App creation
